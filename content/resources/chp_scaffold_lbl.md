description: New materials for artificial joints seek to increase strength without
  sacrificing porosity. This photo shows a scaffolding developed by Antonio Tomsia's
  group at Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory. Using nanoscale particles of calcium
  phosphate (hydroxyapatite), the material features a dense inner core and gradually
  increasing porosity toward the exterior. (Courtesy of Lawrence Berkeley National
